# üòé Fun Projects

This repository contains small JavaScript projects that I built while following tutorials on "YouTube", "Udemy", and other online learning platforms.  
The main goal is to practice understanding code, project structure, and JavaScript logic through practical examples.


### ‚ö° Note
These are not my original projects ‚Äî they were made by following educational materials.  
I rewrote the code manually, followed tutorials step by step, and made small adjustments to better understand web development concepts and code structure.


‚≠ê This repository is my personal playground for learning. It will be interesting to see how it evolves as I start understanding more and more code!
